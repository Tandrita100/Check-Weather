# Check-Weather-app

This project is created by using HTML, Bootstrap CSS and Javascript.
I also used a Weather Api that gives correct information about the weather around the whole world.
It gives the Temperature , Humidity , wind and many other factors.

I found the Api in Rapid Api (https://rapidapi.com/hub) and used Weather by API-Ninjas from Rapid Api (https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/)
I used their free plan you can also use other plans by purchasing them.
